      <documentation>A web application for creating, reading, updating and deleting data elements. The app is configured by the classes loaded at initialization time. The classes govern the choice and the dialog layout for modifying the data. Thus, the same software is used for more or less complex applications. &#xD;

The architecture includes a plugin mechanism to allow the deployment of new transformations or storage adapters without building and deploying a complete new image, for details see ['Design Plugin Mechanism'](https://github.com/GfSE/CASCaDE-Reference-Implementation/issues/21).&#xD;
&#xD;
A major challenge is an optimal design of the programming class structure ('scaffold'), the representation in JSON-LD, RDF/Turtle and GQL according to the [CASCaRA Metamodel](https://product-information-graph.org/doc/metamodel/latest/). Goal is to allow loss-less transformations between all representations. For details see [Optimize the 'magic tetrahedron'](https://github.com/GfSE/CASCaDE-Reference-Implementation/issues/22).&#xD;

      <documentation>The controller is the 'main' component and is in charge of managing the execution of requested services in reaction on user or server events. In the easiest case ES promises are used and the scheduling is left to the event queuing of the execution environment.

So it is the responsibility of the controller to enable and disable elements creating events to maintain the integrity of the app and the data.&#xD;

The fact that the ReqIF Implementation Guideline proposes certain attribute names as a convention, but no names for the entities (called OBJECT-TYPES) themselves, is a challenge for semantic interoperability. However, daily practice has adopted a number of entity names which can be included in the [[any-to.pig.mvf]] to find appropriate ontology classes. It is advised to design the XSL stylesheet for ReqIF in a way that the LONG-NAME of all OBJECT-TYPES is taken as entity class name and to leave all mapping with ontology terms to a subsequent process step, see [[Assign Ontology Classes]].</documentation>

      <documentation>A process to validate the conceptional and technical choices made by the standard in preparation. This is preliminary and needs further discussion and detailing with the target users. Ultimately, the standard must satisfy their use-cases and needs in general.&#xD;
&#xD;
Subject to validation:&#xD;
- Has the [CASCaRA Metamodel](https://product-information-graph.org/doc/metamodel/latest/) enough expressive power to deal with real-world data?&#xD;
- Can the data be transformed between RDF/Turtle, JSON-LD and GQL without loss? In all directions and in a full round-trip?&#xD;
- Are the transformation results consistent, complete, comprehensible and finally useful?&#xD;
- Can the user's 'competency questions' be satisfactorily answered? </documentation>

      <documentation>Different paths of import processing of the [[PIG App]] are shown. They correspond to the edges of the Magic Tetrahedron, which defines the sweet spot where round-trip transformations between RDF, JSON-LD, Object-oriented Data and GQL are possible without loss of information.&#xD;
&#xD;
The input formats defined have different purpose or strength:&#xD;
&#xD;
| Category | Format | Purpose and Strength |&#xD;
| --- | --- | ---|&#xD;
| Processing | OO Classes | Data Processing, Version &amp; Configuration Management, Multi-user Operation |&#xD;
| Processing | JSON | Equivalent with the above for schema checking, storage |&#xD;
| Exchange | PIG JSON-LD | Higher level graph language for API and LD-Processors: Entities and relationships as self-contained objects with URI, standardized type and designated values, explicit, easy to transform |&#xD;
| Exchange | PIG XML | Equivalent with the above for users preferring the XML ecosystem |&#xD;
| Knowledge Graph | RDF/OWL Turtle | For use in the RDF ecosystem: Triple-Stores, SPARQL, SHACL, reasoning, visualization, elegant, compact, needs reasoning to uncover implicit meaning, low level graph („Graph Assembly Language“) |&#xD;
| Knowledge Graph | RDF/OWL JSON-LD | Not planned, as it is redundant with the above |&#xD;
| Knowledge Graph | RDF/OWL XML | Equivalent with the above for users preferring the XML ecosystem |&#xD;
| Property Graph | GQL, Cypher | For use in the ecosystem of Labelled Property Graphs: Graph Databases, superior performance, visualization |&#xD;

  <purpose>This is the concept and design of the PIG App which is a CASCaRA reference implementation used to validate the standard in preparation. &#xD;
&#xD;
The model gives an overview of the use-cases and the architecture, whereas further details are developed via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/GfSE/CASCaDE-Reference-Implementation/issues). The planning is done with a [GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/GfSE/projects/5/views/1). &#xD;
&#xD;
[CASCaRA](https://cascara.gfse.org) is a project to standardize collaboration in systems engineering with respect to data format and ontology. A [Request for Proposal (RFP)](https://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?mantis/24-12-03.pdf) has been accepted by OMG in December 2024. Information in different formats and from diverse sources are transformed and integrated to a common knowledge graph.&#xD;
&#xD;
A publicly available reference implementation shall validate the concepts of the standard as developed by the CASCaRA submission team. Validation is successful, if real-world data is ingested and the information needs of all users in the product lifecycle are met. Users and software vendors are given the opportunity to influence the project to assure their ideas are taken aboard. A joint effort on fundamental features (where differentiation isn't possible anyways) avoids duplicate work, improves quality and assures interoperability.&#xD;
&#xD;
The reference implementation addresses the following aspects:&#xD;
- Check data format and constraints according to the [CASCaRA Metamodel](https://product-information-graph.org/doc/metamodel/latest/) to assure data quality. &#xD;
- Persistently store and retrieve PIG data using the standardized API (to be defined).&#xD;
- View and edit CASCaRA data in a web-browser.&#xD;
- Transform input data with the formats ReqIF, SysML v1 and v2, STEP and FMI/SSP. Other input formats may follow.&#xD;
- Integrate input data with different formats to an interwoven knowledge graph.&#xD;
- Create output data with the formats RDF/Turtle, JSON-LD and XHTML.&#xD;
- Provide a set of *standard queries* ('competency questions') that work for all data complying with the meta-model.&#xD;
- Bring the data into a standardized form to facilitate machine learning and AI applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
Major requirements (capabilities and characteristics) must be satisfied:&#xD;
- **Separation of Concerns**: Syntax and Semantics are separated, so that no software updates are needed, when the ontology evolves over time.&#xD;
- **Design for transformation**: The PIG metamodel (‘magic tetrahedron’) assures loss-less transformation between RDF/OWL (Knowledge Graphs), GQL (Property Graphs) and Object-oriented Programming.&#xD;
- **Federation**: RDF and JSON-LD support dataspaces with federated data under full control of the respective owners.&#xD;
- **Multi-Format Support**: JSON-LD, XML, RDF/Turtle and GQL/Cypher supporting in a wide range of technologies.&#xD;
- Comply with web-technology and avoid proprietary formats.&#xD;
- Extend the software using a documented, if possible standardized plug-in mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
This model is authored with [Archi](https://www.archimatetool.com/) using the ArchiMate 3.2 notation, then transformed to [SpecIF](https://specif.de) via ArchiMate Open Exchange file format and then transformed to HTML. The PIG App will support a similar workflow (among others) for the source data formats chosen.&#xD;
