A <a href="https://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?mantis/24-12-03.pdf">Request for Proposal (RFP)</a> has been accepted by OMG in December 2024. Information in different formats and from diverse sources are transformed and integrated to a common knowledge graph.</p><p>A publicly available reference implementation shall validate the concepts of the standard as developed by the CASCaRA submission team. Validation is successful, if real-world data is ingested and the information needs of all users in the product lifecycle are met. Users and software vendors are given the opportunity to influence the project to assure their ideas are taken aboard. A joint effort on fundamental features (where differentiation isn&#39;t possible anyways) avoids duplicate work, improves quality and assures interoperability.</p><p>The reference implementation addresses the following aspects:</p><ul><li>Check data format and constraints according to the <a href="https://product-information-graph.org/doc/metamodel/latest/">CASCaRA Metamodel</a> to assure data quality.</li><li>Persistently store and retrieve PIG data using the standardized API (to be defined).</li><li>View and edit CASCaRA data in a web-browser.</li><li>Transform input data with the formats ReqIF, SysML v1 and v2, STEP and FMI/SSP.
